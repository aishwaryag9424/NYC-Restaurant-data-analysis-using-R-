# NYC Restaurant data Analysis using R

In this project data analysis is conducted on NYC Resturants food ordering and delivery data set in R programming for data cleansing, preprocessing, descriptive statistics, fitted various probability distribution (normal, exponential) to the data, Hypothesis testing (t-test, F-test, Goodness of fit) to draw meaningful conclusions from the data.

# Statistical features:

**Normal Distribution:** The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution or bell curve, is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric around its mean, denoted by Î¼ (mu). The shape of the normal distribution is characterized by the probability density function (PDF).

**Exponential Distribution:** The exponential distribution is a continuous probability distribution that describes the time between events in a Poisson process, where events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate.

**T-Test:** The t-test is used to compare the means of two groups to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between them.\
Types:
1. Independent Samples T-Test: Compares the means of two independent groups.
2. Paired Samples T-Test: Compares the means of two related groups (e.g., repeated measures on the same individuals).

**F-Test:** The F-test is used for comparing variances or testing the equality of means among more than two groups.\
Types:
1. One-Way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): Tests if there are any statistically significant differences between the means of three or more independent groups.
2. Two-Way ANOVA: Extends the one-way ANOVA to two independent variables.
