# Statistical features:

Normal Distribution: The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution or bell curve, is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric around its mean, denoted by Î¼ (mu). The shape of the normal distribution is characterized by the probability density function (PDF).
__
Exponential Distribution: The exponential distribution is a continuous probability distribution that describes the time between events in a Poisson process, where events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate.
